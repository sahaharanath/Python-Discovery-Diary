# P14-Comparison Operators.py
# Demonstrates comparison operators in Python.

# Example 1: '==' Operator (Equal)
print("'==' Operator")
x = 10
y = 10
print(x == y)  # True, as x is equal to y

# Example 2: '!=' Operator (Not Equal)
print("'!=' Operator")
a = 5
b = 6
print(a != b)  # True, as a is not equal to b

# Example 3: '>' Operator (Greater Than)
print("'>' Operator")
c = 15
d = 8
print(c > d)  # True, as c is greater than d

# Example 4: '<' Operator (Less Than)
print("'<' Operator")
j = 9
l = 10
print(j < l)  # True, as j is less than l

# Example 5: '<=' Operator (Less Than or Equal To)
print("'<=' Operator")
s = 100
f = 56
print(s <= y)  # False, as s is not less than or equal to y

# Example 6: '>=' Operator (Greater Than or Equal To)
print("'>=' Operator")
z = 89
r = 67
print(z >= r)  # True, as z is greater than or equal to r
